Eskapade supports the use of `Apache Spark <https://spark.apache.org>`_ for parallel processing of large data volumes.
Jobs can run on a single laptop using Spark libraries as well as on a Spark/Hadoop cluster in combination with YARN.
This section describes how to setup and configure Spark for use with Eskapade. For examples on running Spark jobs with
Eskapade, see the `Spark tutorial <tutorial_spark.html>`_.

.. note ::

  Eskapade supports both batch and streaming processing with Apache Spark.

Requirements
____________

A working setup of the Apache Spark libraries is included in both the Eskapade docker and vagrant image
(see section `Installation <installation.html>`_). For installation of Spark libraries in a custom setup,
please refer to the Spark `documentation <https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/>`_.

Spark installation
::::::::::::::::::

The environment variables ``SPARK_HOME`` and ``PYTHONPATH`` need be set and to point to the location of the Spark
installation and the Python libraries of Spark and ``py4j`` (dependency). In the Eskapade docker, for example, it is set to:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ echo $SPARK_HOME
  /opt/spark/pro/
  $ echo $PYTHONPATH
  /opt/spark/pro/python:/opt/spark/pro/python/lib/py4j-0.10.4-src.zip:...

Configuration
_____________

The Spark configuration can be set in two ways:

1. an Eskapade macro (preferred)
2. an Eskapade link 

This is demonstrated in the following tutorial macro:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ eskapade_run python/eskapade/tutorials/esk601_spark_configuration.py

Both methods are described below. For a full explanation of Spark configuration settings, see
`Spark Configuration <http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.1/configuration.html>`_.
In case configuration settings seem not to be picked up correctly, please check `Notes`_ at the end of this section.

Eskapade macro (preferred)
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This method allows to specify settings per macro, i.e. per analysis, and is therefore the preferred way for bookkeeping analysis-specific settings. 

The most easy way to start a Spark session is:

.. code-block:: python

  from eskapade import process_manager
  from eskapade.spark_analysis import SparkManager

  spark = sm.create_session(eskapade_settings=settings)
  sc = spark.sparkContext

The default Spark configuration file ``python/eskapade/config/spark/spark.cfg`` will be picked up. It contains the following settings:

.. code-block:: bash

  [spark]
  spark.app.name=es_spark
  spark.jars.packages=org.diana-hep:histogrammar-sparksql_2.11:1.0.4
  spark.master=local[*]
  spark.driver.host=localhost

The default Spark settings can be adapted here for all macros at once. In case, alternative settings are only relevant for a single analysis, those settings can also be specified in the macro using the argument variables in the ``create_session`` method of the SparkManager:

.. code-block:: python

  from eskapade import process_manager
  from eskapade.spark_analysis import SparkManager

  spark = sm.create_session(spark_settings=[('spark.app.name', 'es_spark_alt_config'), ('spark.master', 'local[42]')])

  sm = process_manager.service(SparkManager)
  spark = sm.create_session(eskapade_settings=settings,
                            spark_settings=spark_settings,
                            config_path='/path/to/alternative/spark.cfg',
                            enable_hive_support=False,
                            include_eskapade_modules=False
                           )

Where all arguments are optional:

   * ``eskapade_settings`` default configuration file as specified by the ``sparkCfgFile`` key in ConfigObject (i.e. ``spark.cfg``)
   * ``config_path`` alternative path to configuration file 
   * ``spark_settings``  list of key-value pairs to specify additional Spark settings
   * ``enable_hive_support``: switch to disable/enable Spark Hive support
   * ``include_eskapade_modules``: switch to include/exclude Eskapade modules in Spark job submission (e.g. for user-defined functions)

Eskapade link
:::::::::::::

This method allows to (re-)start Spark sessions from within a ``SparkConfigurator`` link. This means that by specifying
multiple instances of this link in a macro, multiple Spark sessions with different settings can sequentially be run.
This can be useful for larger analysis jobs that contain multiple Spark queries with very different CPU/memory needs -
although the recently introduced `Dynamic allocation`_ feature is a more elegant way to achieve this behaviour.

Configurations for Spark jobs are set via the ``SparkConf`` class that holds a list of key/value pairs with settings, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

  from eskapade import Chain
  from eskapade.spark_analysis import SparkConfigurator

  conf_link = SparkConfigurator(name='SparkConfigurator', spark_settings=[('spark.master', 'local[3]')])
  conf_link.log_level = 'INFO'
  config = Chain('Config')
  config.add(conf_link)

Note that the ``SparkConfigurator`` stops any existing Spark session before starting a new one. This means that the user
should make sure all relevant data is stored at this point, since all cached Spark data will be cleared from memory.

Parameters
__________

The most important parameters to play with for optimal performance:

- ``num-executors``
- ``executor-cores``
- ``executor-memory``
- ``driver-memory``

Dynamic allocation
::::::::::::::::::

Since version 2.1, Spark allows for `dynamic resouce allocation <https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.1/job-scheduling.html#dynamic-resource-allocation>`_.
This requires the following settings:

- ``spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true``
- ``spark.shuffle.service.enabled=true``

Depending on the mode (standalone, YARN, Mesos), an additional shuffle service needs to be set up. See the documentation for details.

Logging
_______

The logging level of Spark can be controlled in two ways:

1. through ``$SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j.properties`` 

.. code-block:: bash

  log4j.logger.org.apache.spark.api.python.PythonGatewayServer=INFO

2. through the ``SparkContext`` in Python:

.. code-block:: python

  spark = process_manager.service(SparkManager).get_session()
  spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel('INFO')


PS: the loggers in Python can be controlled through:

.. code-block:: python

   import logging
   print(logging.Logger.manager.loggerDict) # obtain list of all registered loggers
   logging.getLogger('py4j').setLevel('INFO')
   logging.getLogger('py4j.java_gateway').setLevel('INFO')  

However, not all Spark-related loggers are available here (as they are JAVA-based).

Notes
_____

There are a few pitfalls w.r.t. setting up Spark correctly: 

1. If the environment variable ``PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS`` is defined, its settings may override those specified
in the macro/link. This can be prevented by unsetting the variable:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ unset PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS

or in the macro: 

.. code-block:: python

  import os
  del os.environ['PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS']

The former will clear the variable from the shell session, whereas the latter will only clear it in the Python session.

2. In client mode not all driver options set via ``SparkConf`` are picked up at job submission because the JVM has
already been started. Those settings should therefore be passed through the ``SPARK_OPTS`` environment variable,
instead of using ``SparkConf`` in an Eskapade macro or link:

.. code-block:: bash

  SPARK_OPTS=--driver-java-options=-Xms1024M --driver-java-options=-Xmx4096M --driver-java-options=-Dlog4j.logLevel=info --driver-memory 2g 

3. In case a Spark machine is not connected to a network, setting the ``SPARK_LOCAL_HOSTNAME`` environment variable or
the ``spark.driver.host`` key in ``SparkConf`` to the value ``localhost`` may fix DNS resolution timeouts which prevent
Spark from starting jobs.
